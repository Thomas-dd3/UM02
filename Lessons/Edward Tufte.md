# Edward Tufte
- He is an analytical design theorist
### 6 principles:
1. Strive for graphical integrity
* THE LIE FACTOR: How much you lie in your visualization.
For example, in a bar chart you can divide the longest bar by the smallest and look if the result is correct according of their initial value.
* 1st PRINCIPLE
- The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graph itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented.
- So be careful with 3D
* 2nd PRINCIPLE
Clear, detailed and thorough labelling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity.
 - Title, headline, legend + label if needed!
 - (Explain what you are doing)
* 3rd PRINCIPLE
 - Show data variation, not design variation
* 4th PRINCIPLE
 - In time-series, displays of money is better with deflated and standardized units than nominal units (euro, dollarâ€¦)
* 5th PRINCIPLE => refer Bertin
 - The number of information carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data
 - Graphics must not quote data out of the context

2.	Maximize data ink
* 1st PRINCIPLE: Above all else show data.
* 2st PRINCIPLE: Maximize the data-ink ratio.
* 3rd PRINCIPLE: Erase non-data-ink.
* 4th PRINCIPLE: Erase redundant data-ink.
* 5th PRINCIPLE: Revise and edit.

3. Avoid chart junk
The excessive and unnecessary use of graphical effects in graphs used to demonstrate the data.

4. Data density

5. Design solutions

* Small multiplies: series of the same small graph repeated in one visual.
* Sparklines
* Time series

6. Aesthetics & technique

- Have a properly chosen format and design
- Use words, numbers, and drawing together
- Reflect a balance, a proportion, a sense of relevant scale
- Display an accessible complexity of detail
- Have a narrative quality, a story to tell about the data
- Draw elements in a professional manner, with the technical details of production done with care
- Avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk
