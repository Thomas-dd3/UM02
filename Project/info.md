The map and dynamic map or accessible just by clicking on the index.html with a computer connected to internet in order to download the map.
You can also look at my dynamic map at this address: https://thomas-dd3.github.io/
and look at my static map at this address: https://thomas-dd3.github.io/index-static-map.html

For the 2 maps, you will also find in my folder a screenshot of the view I have. The design have been made on a screen quite small so it could change on a bigger screen.

Last thing, for the dynamic map, you can click on cities (those with a red point) to get the information relative to the city you clicked on.
